## Introduction

During the AI Builders Glasgow 2025 hackathon, we built Link, a PoC that breaks down any structured or unstructured data into atomic claims with color-coded truth verification, creating an intelligent fact-checking system with three-dimensional graphs for which we got 1st place ðŸ¥‡.

## Tech Stack

- [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) â€“ for the entire system (yes, really)
- [Chronicle](https://chroniclehq.com/) â€“ for slides

## Demo + Slides

The video below shows the final product, which runs through the home page, dashboard & a sample three-dimensional graph generated from content. The slides can be accessed [here](https://app.chroniclehq.com/share/24a607b4-09f6-490e-b4e1-d45eb7e5ae0c/09378eea-b9c7-4a8a-ad1d-930a138bb983/41a2f441-008a-4ba2-948a-559a2b99b7a1).
